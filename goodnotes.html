        <h3>Understand</h3>
        <p>GoodNotes' mission is to empower people with knowledge through digital paper and innovations, whilst making studying <b>efficient and enjoyable</b>.
            Thus, GoodNotes bases their success on the success of its users—how
            well students <b>understand</b> their desired topic. With this in mind, the team approached us with the following question:</p>
        <h2>How might we help students using GoodNotes feel more confident that they understand a subject?</h2>

            <p>Despite this discrepancy, we focused on <b>self-reported levels of confidence</b> (instead of test scores)

                    Low-confidence students struggled with efficient note-taking.</p>

                <p>When faced with dense information—such as a fast-talking professor—low-confidence students found it burdening to keep up with the lecture.
                    Hence, they struggled to <b>prioritize and structure</b> content, <b>getting lost</b> in the process.</p>

                <p class="no-top-margin">Revising one's notes requires <b>cognitive engagement</b>, which, in turn, helps the note-taker retain its content<sup>[1]</sup>.
                This was consistent with our findings, as higher-confidence students reported to <b>review and revise</b> their notes <b>more often</b> than low-confidence students.</p>

        <img style="margin: 2rem 0;" src="img/goodnotes/journey map.svg">

        <p>When taking notes during lectures, low-confidence students frequently found themselves <b>over-simplifying or falling behind</b> while trying to keep pace with their professors.
            Thus, due to the haphazard note-taking, students <b>got lost in their own notes</b> when the time came to study for their exams.</p>
        <p>Having these in mind, our tool not only needed to guide students <b>while taking</b> their notes, but be helpful during the subsequent <b>reviewing process</b>.</p>

        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <h2>After evaluating our ideas, we settled on an interactive note-tagging & reminder system.</h2>

        <img class="border" src="img/goodnotes/matrix.svg" alt="Using an Effort x Impact Matrix to decide on an idea.">

        <p>From our Impact x Effort Matrix, we found the ideas with the greatest impact to be <b>interactive note-taking and studying methods</b> such as adding tags or using markdown segmentation in notes, or sending out reminders per study material.</p>
        <p>However, I deemed <b>markdown segmentation</b> required <b>high effort</b> to the point where it was <b>infeasible</b>, 
            as it is most suited for typed-platforms such as GitHub and Obsidian, compared to GoodNotes and its focus on hand-written notes.
            It also has a <b>high-learning curve</b> which can be burdening for the users.

        <h2>GoodNotes Tags & Reminders combines the best of digital and paper note-taking.</h2>
        <img class="border" src="img/goodnotes/dd-tags.png" alt="">
        <p>Inspired from paper sticky notes, we wanted the experience of GoodNotes Tags to feel <b>intuitive</b>—like when actually tagging one’s notes with post-its.
        Combined with Reminders, we imagine GoodNotes to be differentiated from pen-and-paper by showcasing the strengths only <b>digital platforms</b> can have.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="padding">
        <h2>Tags<span class="material-symbols-rounded medium">
            bookmark</span>: Adding familiar visual cues to notes.</h2>
        <img src="img/goodnotes/dd-visual cue.png" alt="" class="border">
        <p>In our initial iteration, we experimented with straightforward designs with tag names explictly embedded within the shape.
            However, I thought the text on the tags felt overwhelming when paired with the notes, with the design itself lacking a clear visual identity.</p>
        <p>Our final design resembles paper sticky notes, implementing an <b>easily distinguishable</b> yet <b>simple</b> appearance for <b>immediate visual cues</b>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="padding">
        <h2>Tags<span class="material-symbols-rounded medium">

        <video class="border" autoplay controls muted>
            <source src="img/goodnotes/dd-toolbar.mp4"/>
        </video>
        <p>Previously, we placed tags within GoodNotes' toolbar alongside the rest of its features. 
            Yet, during <b>user testing</b>, we realized this was <b>not</b> convenient
            as users had to repeatedly <b>drag and drop</b> the tags from the toolbar, interrupting their flow of note-taking.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="padding">
        <div id="gn-longpress">

            <div>
                <img src="img/goodnotes/dd-longtap.png" alt="">
                <p>Instead, I advocated for a <b>long-press interaction</b> to insert the tags. This way, students are able to quickly add a tag <b>wherever they are</b> on the screen.</p>
                <p>Although the tags would be taken out of the toolbar, both the clients and the team agreed that a long-press pop-up modal remained readily discoverable and rather enhanced the efficiency of the workflow.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="padding">
        <p>With the updated entry point, we explored many interfaces for the insert tag modal. I ultimately landed on a <b>consistent design</b> for the buttons, where the <b>name, color, and shape</b> of the tags could be shown.</p>

        <img src="img/goodnotes/dd-inserttag.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="padding">
        <h2>Reminders<span class="material-symbols-rounded medium">
            event</span>: Encouraging you to study—without being annoying.</h2>

        <img class="border" src="img/goodnotes/dd-reminder-old.png" alt="">

        <p>Originally, we <b>integrated Tags and Reminders</b>, imagining a feature where users could activate reminders specifically for a particular type of tag. 
            For example, if a user wished to enable reminders exclusively for the "Question" and "Review" tags within their "Lecture 34" notes, they would only receive notifications for these tags.</p>
        <p>However, in the <b>edge case</b> where the user would turn on reminders for all their tags, they would get <b>bombarded</b> with notifications for the <b>same file</b>—which would quickly become annoying.</p>
 
        <img src="img/goodnotes/dd-reminder-new.png" alt="">

        <p>To solve this issue, we ultimately decided to <b>separate</b> the two features—Tags and Reminders—and let the Reminders live under the settings of each file.
            This way, users can receive a <b>consolidated reminder</b> per each file, instead of being notified by every type of tag.</p>

        <h3>Reflection & Takeaways</h3>
        <img src="img/goodnotes/reflection w comments.png" alt="">
        <p>While my role during this semester-long project was to mentor and lead other student designers of Berkeley Innovation, I, in-turn, learned so much from my team and our clients Rodney and Leo<i>!</i></p>

        <h2>Users, users. Always go back to the users.</h2>
        <p>The culture of GoodNotes focuses heavily on UXR and tying every design decision to insights and user habits—and they weren't hesitant on getting us onboard with their culture.
            It's important to constantly check the <b>intent of the designs</b> and to make sure they actually <b>address the problem</b> at hand, without creating additional complications. After all, I am designing for the users, not myself.</p>
        <!-- <h2>🧑‍🎨 Designing for an existing system.</h2>
        <p>GoodNotes is an iOS app used and loved by thousands and more; its app and design system are pretty much set-in-stone. Thus, we had to make sure our designs were well-integrated to the app, neither startling prior users nor disrupting the existing structure, interface, and flow.</p> -->
        <h2>Getting inspiration from your surroundings.</h2>
        <p>While GoodNotes is a digital app, it still highly maintains a physical counterpart—note-taking by hand. Thus, we looked into physical designs and daily experiences for inspiration, which led us to the idea of index tabs ("Tags"). 
            This idea, then, would not only be <b>familiar</b> for users but be <b>intuitive</b> to use.</p>
        <p>Digital designs don't mean I should strictly look into the digital realm for inspiration; sometimes, the solution lies more intimate to our everyday lives.</p>
