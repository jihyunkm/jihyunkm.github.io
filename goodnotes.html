        <p>From our Impact x Effort Matrix, we found the ideas with the greatest impact to be <b>interactive note-taking methods</b> such as adding tags or using markdown segmentation in notes, or sending out reminders per study material.</p>
        <p>However, I deemed <b>markdown segmentation</b> required <b>high effort</b> to the point where it was <b>infeasible</b>, 
            as it is most suited for typed-platforms such as GitHub and Obsidian, compared to GoodNotes and its focus on hand-written notes.
            It also has a <b>high-learning curve</b> which can be burdening for the users.

        <h3>The design concept</h3>
        <h2>üè∑ Inspired from paper sticky notes, GoodNotes Tags aims to combine the best of two worlds‚Äîdigital and paper.</h2>
        <img class="border" src="img/goodnotes/dd-tags.png" alt="">
        <p>Just like when tagging one‚Äôs book with physical sticky notes, we wanted the experience of GoodNotes Tags to feel <b>intuitive</b>, yet 
            be differentiated from pen-and-paper by showcasing the strengths only <b>digital platforms</b> can have.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="padding container-small">
        <h3>Some design decisions we faced</h3>
        <h2>1. Bringing familiarity and visual cues to notes.</h2>
        <img src="img/goodnotes/dd-visual cue.png" alt="" class="border">
        <p>In our initial iteration, we experimented with straightforward designs with tag names explictly embedded within the shape.
            However, I thought the text on the tags felt overwhelming when paired with the notes, with the design itself lacking a clear visual identity.</p>
        <p>Our final design resembles paper sticky notes, implementing an <b>easily distinguishable</b> yet <b>simple</b> appearance for <b>immediate visual cues</b>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="padding container-small">
        <h2>2. Streamlining for the optimal workflow.</h2>
        <video class="border" autoplay controls muted>
            <source src="img/goodnotes/dd-toolbar.mp4"/>
        </video>
        <p>Previously, we placed tags within GoodNotes' toolbar alongside the rest of its features. 
            Yet, during user testing, we realized this was <b>not</b> convenient
            as users had to repeatedly <b>drag and drop</b> the tags, interrupting their note-taking.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="padding container-medium">
        <div id="gn-longpress">
            <video class="border" autoplay controls muted>
                <source src="img/goodnotes/dd-longtap.mp4"/>
            </video>
            <div>
                <img src="img/goodnotes/dd-longtap.png" alt="">
                <p>Instead, I advocated for a <b>long-press interaction</b> to insert the tags. This way, students are able to quickly add a tag <b>wherever they are</b> on the screen.</p>
                <p>Although the tags would be taken out of the toolbar, both the clients and the team agreed that a long-press pop-up modal remained readily discoverable and rather enhanced the efficiency of the workflow.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="padding container-small">
        <p>With the updated entry point, we explored many interfaces for the insert tag modal. I ultimately landed on a <b>consistent design</b> for the buttons, where the <b>name, color, and shape</b> of the tags could be shown.</p>
