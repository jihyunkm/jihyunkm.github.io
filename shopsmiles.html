        <h2>While ShopSmiles has high user traffic, these visits rarely translated to actual purchases.</h2>

                    From landscape analyses and user interviews, 
                    we concluded shoppers are <b>most curious</b> of a product's:</p>

            <div>
                <p>The business team also required that we include <b>secondary information</b> such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sale percentage</li>
                    <li>Original & discounted price</li>

    <div class="container-medium">
        <p>While <b>6 variations</b> of the product card lived in the ShopSmiles design system, 
            many were <b>redundant</b> due to similar layouts with minor dimensional differences.

        <h3>Ideation</h3>

        <h2>The business team's request: a color picker.</h2>
        <p>Previous ShopSmiles' product cards did not show color options, as most of its products are offered in a <b>single color</b>. 
            However, the business team requested a color picker for the products offered in multiple colors, meaning
            those offered in only one color would <b>instead</b> have to show:</p>
        <img class="border" src="img/shopsmiles/color picker options.png" alt="">
    </div>
        
    <div class="padding container-medium">
        <p>Additionally, we decided to display the mobile Top Picks in a <b>carousel</b> to <b>reduce the time</b> it took users to reach the reviews.
        This meant that I had to make sure to <b>minimize</b> the number of complex <b>haptic controls</b> (i.e., nested scrolling, pop-up in a scroll), as the color picker would introduce more interactions.
        </p>
        <img src="img/shopsmiles/top picks color picker w gradient.png" class="margin-add">
    </div>

    <div class="padding container-medium">
        <p>Once the card elements were finalized, I started iterating on 
            the <b>medium-sized product card</b> as it was both the intermediary size 
            and dealt with the most restrictions (as it's suited for mobile screens).
            I would then adapt its design to the large and small-sized product card.</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="container-medium">
        <h2 class="padding">Iteration 1: Wide instead of narrow cards</h2>
        <img class="border" src="img/shopsmiles/narrow wide.png">

                <p>Narrow cards allow for higher comparability (can view more products on a single screen), but <b>hinders the tappability</b> of elements, especially for those with small mobile screens.
                Wide cards, on the other hand, might take up more space on the screen, but in turn offer greater <b>accessibility and legibility</b>—making it the ultimate winner.</p>
            
        <div class="bubble-icon">
            <h2><span class="material-symbols-rounded">emoji_objects</span></h2>

            <div>
                <span><b><i>What I learned...</i></b></span>
                <p class="txt-small">Here, we have the typical business vs. UX dilemma—showing more cards for more opportunities for sale versus the contrast to increase accessibility.
                    However, UX teams should always advocate for the user, even more so when accessibility is involved.</p>
                <p class="txt-small">In fact, <i>accessibility -> more users have access -> higher potential for sales, a double win!</i></p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="padding container-medium">
        <h2>Iteration 2: An intuitive color picker</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="container-medium">
        <img class="border" src="img/shopsmiles/intuitive color picker.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="container-medium">
        <p>Due to the principles of proximity, the empty gap looked confusing when placed in a grid.
            The single-option color picker, on the other hand, featured an unintentional design that took up real estate.
        </p>
        <p>To avoid the possible confusion and make the most efficient use of space, I moved forward with the <b>third option</b> despite the variable height.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="padding container-medium">
        <img class="border" src="img/shopsmiles/cta size.png" alt="">
        <p>To "extra-ensure" the issue was addressed, we reduced the <b>width of the call-to-action (CTA)</b> on desktop cards, as desktop screens primarily utilized the grid layout.
            I left the <b>mobile CTA untouched</b>, since:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>No mobile screen uses the grid layout (thus, less confusing)</li>
            <li>The longer width allows for a bigger & more accessible touch area</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="padding container-medium">
        <h2>Iteration 3: An accessible color picker</h2>
        <p>However, as we still weren't satisfied with the problem of variable heights, I also came up with a <b>fourth idea</b>: nesting the color selections in a separate button that would prompt to an overlay.
            This button would be always docked, solving the problems of an empty gap or misalignment.</p>
        <!-- <img src="img/shopsmiles/overlay options.gif"> -->
        <div class="grid-col-2">
            <video autoplay loop muted class="border" src="img/shopsmiles/overlay option 1.mp4"></video>
            <video autoplay loop muted class="border" src="img/shopsmiles/overlay option 2.mp4"></video>
        </div>
        <p>While the idea gained support from the engineering team, we dismissed it as it was ultimately <b>inaccessible</b>, especially for those with screen readers.
            The design would also:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be too <b>complex</b> if embedded within a mobile carousel</li>
            <li>Feel <b>intrusive</b>, causing frequent UX frustrations</li>
        </ul>

                <span><b><i>What I learned...</i></b></span>
                <p class="txt-small">While my last idea turned out to be inaccessible, I still learned that the more ideas, the better:</p>
                <p class="txt-small">By ruling out more and more ideas, not only is there more opportunity to justify the best-design-standing, but I can experiment and understand
                    more about the restrictions (here, I learned more about what was possible within the engineering restrictions).</p>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <h2>My team eventually fleshed out the entire design system with the new cards.</h2>
        <p>As previously mentioned, we were able to successfully <b>reduce the component variation</b> of product cards (base state without the color picker) from 6 to 3.</p>

        <img src="img/shopsmiles/reduced variation.png">

        <p>My mentor and I also <b>documented and redlined</b> the new cards, explicitly indicating its usage, spacing, touch areas, and more, for ShopSmiles' developers and any other involved.</p>

        <h2>My designs are currently <a href="https://shop.colgate.com/" target="_blank" class="external-link">live</a>,
            successfully kicking off ShopSmiles' UX overhaul.</h2>
        <p>Since its launch in January 2023, ShopSmiles' <b>bounce rates decreased by ~20%</b> while the 
            average number of <b>pages visited per session increased by 0.5</b>*. 
            This means that users are now spending more time browsing on ShopSmiles than before.</p>
        <p>These numbers are anticipated to further improve as the remaining redesigns for ShopSmiles are rolled out. 
            I also participated in reimagining the information architecture of ShopSmiles' product description page (PDP) 
            through user research. Contact me for details if you want to learn more.

        <p class="caption">*As my internship concluded before I could observe the precise impact, 
            I sourced these figures from a <a href="https://www.semrush.com/" target="_blank">third-party site</a>.</p>

    <h3>If I had more time...</h3>
    <h2>User testing to see what works vs. doesn't.</h2>
    <p>Because of time limitations and frequent changes in business constraints, we were not able to perform formal usability tests with our designs
        and rather relied on internal feedback from developers and marketing.
        Given more time on the project, I would have liked to conduct user testing on actual users to verify 
        whether the designs had effectively enhanced the 
        ShopSmiles browsing experience.

    <h3>Reflection & Takeaways</h3>
    <h2>While at Colgate, I not only grew as a designer, but gained valuable work ethics & soft skills.</h2>
    <p>Hands down, my teammates at Colgate-Palmolive's UX team were one of the most supportive and enjoyable people to work with! Although my time at Colgate was short-lived, I learned so much not only about the design process but the cross-functional nature of UX design.</p>
    <img src="img/shopsmiles/reflection w comments.png" class="margin-add">
    <p>Some takeaways from my time at Colgate-Palmolive:</p>
    <h2>Good designers design for everyone.</h2>
    <p>As a company with a large user base, the UX team was especially concerned with the 
        <b>accessibility</b> of its products. A lot of effort was placed into making our designs accessible, whether it be designing for a screen reader or the smallest mobile screen size possible.</p>
    <h2>Organization & documentation is key.</h2>
    <p>Colgate-Palmolive is hundreds of years old, with numerous departments and roles. From this environment, I learned that it's ever-important to <b>keep a record</b> of everything you did and, most importantly, <b><i>why</i> you did them</b>.</p>
    <p>Good organization and documentation not only makes it easier to refer back to one's own work, but makes it easier for others as well—whether it be for hand-offs, working in cross-functional environments, or, simply, efficient communication.</p>
