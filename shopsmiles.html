        <p>A card's content depends on what information users deem most important.</p>
        <p>From landscape analyses and user interviews, we concluded that shoppers are most curious of a <b>product's image, name, ratings,</b> and <b>price</b>.
            The business team also required that we include <b>secondary information</b> such as the sale percentage and the original price, new or best sellers, etc.

        <p>Currently, <b>6 variations</b> of the product card live in the ShopSmiles design system. 
            However, I realized that they could easily be <b>reduced to 4</b>, as I boiled their main instances down to the following:</p>
        <p>üñ• Desktop</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Vertical cards:</b> Home, Search, Product Listing Page</li>

            Instead of a slightly longer horizontal card for the desktop Top Picks (PDP), we could use either the vertical desktop or the newly consolidated horizontal card,
            resulting in <b>3 product card components</b> for ShopSmiles.

        <h2>üé® The business team's request: as some products are offered in multiple colors, they wanted a color picker featured on the cards.</h2>

            <div class="grid-column center-text">

            </div>
            <div class="grid-column center-text">

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="padding container-small">
        <p>Additionally, we decided to display the mobile Top Picks in a <b>carousel</b> instead of a list, changing the card to a vertical layout, to <b>reduce the time</b> it took users to reach the reviews.</p>
        <p>This meant that I had to make sure to <b>minimize</b> the number of <b>complex haptic controls</b> (i.e., nested scrolling, pop-up in a scroll), as the color picker would introduce more interactions.

                <p>Here, we have the typical business vs. UX dilemma‚Äîshowing more cards for more opportunities for sale versus the contrast to increase accessibility.
                    However, UX teams should always advocate for the user, even more so when accessibility is involved.</p>

        <h2>2. An intuitive color picker</h2>
        <p>Due to the principles of proximity, the empty gap in place of an inactive color picker looked <b>confusing</b> when placed in a grid.</p>

        <div class="column-2">

        <img class="border" src="img/shopsmiles/cta size.png" alt="">
        <p>To extra-ensure the issue was addressed, we reduced the <b>width of the call-to-action (CTA)</b> on desktop cards, as desktop screens primarily utilized the grid layout.
            I left the <b>mobile CTA untouched</b>, since (1) no mobile screen used the grid layout and (2) the longer width allowed for a bigger touch area.

                <p>However, as we still weren't satisfied with the problem of variable heights, I also came up with a <b>fourth idea</b>: nesting the color selections in a separate button that would prompt to an overlay.</p>
                <p>This button would be always docked, solving the problems of an empty gap or misalignment.</p>

        <p>While the idea gained support from the engineering team, we dismissed it as it was ultimately <b>inaccessible</b>, especially for those with screen readers.</p>
        <p>The design would also: (1) be too <b>complex</b> if embedded within a mobile carousel and 
            (2) feel <b>intrusive</b>, causing frequent UX frustrations.</p>

                    <p>By ruling out more and more ideas, not only is there more opportunity to justify the best-design-standing, but I can experiment and understand
                        more about the restrictions (here, I learned more about the engineering restrictions).</p>

        <h2>üõ≥ Designs are live<i>!</i></h2>
        <p>The product card designs are currently <a href="https://shop.colgate.com/" target="_blank" class="external-link">live</a>, successfully marking the first of many redesigns planned to launch for ShopSmiles.</p>
        <p>Product cards are integral to the ecosystem of ShopSmiles, and while I was not able to witness and track the metrics of its impact,
            the redesign is projected to <b>greatly influence users' browsing journeys</b>‚Äîespecially those that drive purchase decisions.</p>
        <p>Additionally, feel free to <a href="https://www.jihyunkim.me/colgate-uxr" target="_blank" class="external-link">read more</a> on how I not only redesigned, 
            but restructured the shopping experience on ShopSmiles with research.</p>

        <h3>If I had more time...</h3>
        <h2>üéô User testing to see what works vs. doesn't.</h2>
        <p>Because of time limitations, the shipment of my designs took place after the completion of my 10-week internship at Colgate-Palmolive.
            Given more time on the project, I would have liked to perform user testing to verify whether the designs had effectively enhanced users' 
            browsing experience on ShopSmiles.

        <h3>Reflection & Takeaways</h3>
        <h2>ü™¥ During my time at Colgate-Palmolive, I not only grew as a designer but gained valuable work ethics and soft skills.</h2>
        <p>Hands down, my teammates at Colgate's UX Team were one of the most supportive and enjoyable people to work with! Although my time at Colgate was short-lived, I learned so much not only about the design process but the cross-functional nature of UX design.</p>
        <img src="img/shopsmiles/reflection w comments.png" class="margin-add">
        <p>Some takeaways from my time at Colgate-Palmolive:</p>
        <h2>üôÜ Good designers design for everyone.</h2>
        <p>As a company with a large user base, the UX team was especially concerned with the 
            <b>accessibility</b> of its products. A lot of effort was placed into making our designs accessible, whether it be designing for a screen reader or the smallest mobile screen size possible.</p>
        <h2>üóÉ Organization & documentation is key.</h2>
        <p>Colgate-Palmolive is hundreds of years old, with numerous departments and roles. From this environment, I learned that it's ever-important to <b>keep a record</b> of everything you did and, most importantly, <b><i>why</i> you did them</b>.</p>
        <p>Good organization and documentation not only makes it easier to refer back to one's own work, but makes it easier for others as well‚Äîwhether it be for hand-offs, working in cross-functional environments, or, simply, efficient communication.</p>
