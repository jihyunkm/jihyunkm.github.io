        <p>A card's content depends on what information users deem most important.</p>

        <h3>Ideation</h3>

        <h2>The business team's request: as some products are offered in multiple colors, they wanted a color picker featured on the cards.</h2>
        <p>Previous ShopSmiles' product cards did not show color options, as most of its products are offered in a <b>single color</b>. 
            However, the business team requested a color picker for the products offered in multiple colors, meaning
            those offered in only one color would <b>instead</b> have to show:</p>
        <div style="display: grid; grid-auto-flow: column; column-gap: 1rem;">
            <div class="center-text">
                <p>1. A single color selection in the color picker</p>
                <img src="img/shopsmiles/color picker spacing 1.png">
            </div>
            <div class="center-text">
                <p>2. An empty gap with a fixed card height</p>
                <img src="img/shopsmiles/color picker spacing 2.png">
            </div>
            <div class="center-text">
                <p>3. Have no gap with a variable height</p>
                <img src="img/shopsmiles/color picker spacing 3.png">
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
        
    <div class="padding container-small">
        <p>Additionally, we decided to display the mobile Top Picks in a <b>carousel</b> instead of a list, changing the card to a vertical layout, to <b>reduce the time</b> it took users to reach the reviews.</p>
        <p>This meant that I had to make sure to <b>minimize</b> the number of <b>complex haptic controls</b> (i.e., nested scrolling, pop-up in a scroll), as the color picker would introduce more interactions.
        </p>
        <img src="img/shopsmiles/top picks color picker w gradient.png" class="margin-add">
    </div>

    <div class="padding container-small">
        <p>Once the card elements were finalized, I started iterating on 
            the <b>medium-sized product card</b> as it was both the intermediary size 
            and dealt with the most restrictions (as it's suited for mobile screens).
        </p>
        <p>I would then adapt its design to the large and small-sized product card.</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="padding container-small">
        <h2>Iteration 1: Wide instead of narrow cards</h2>
        <img class="border" src="img/shopsmiles/narrow wide.png">

                <p>Narrow cards allow for <b>higher comparability</b> (can view more products on a single screen), but <b>hinders the tappability</b> of elements, especially for those with small mobile screens.</p>
                <p>Wide cards, on the other hand, might take up more space on the screen, but in turn offer greater <b>accessibility and legibility.</b></p>
            
        <div class="bubble-icon yellow">
            <h2>üí°</h2>
            <div>
                <span><b><i>What I learned...</i></b></span>
                <p>Here, we have the typical business vs. UX dilemma‚Äîshowing more cards for more opportunities for sale versus the contrast to increase accessibility.
                    However, UX teams should always advocate for the user, even more so when accessibility is involved.</p>
                <p>In fact, <i>accessibility -> more users have access -> higher potential for sales!</i> ü§î</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="padding container-small">
        <h2>Iteration 2: An intuitive color picker</h2>
        <p>Due to the principles of proximity, the empty gap in place of an inactive color picker looked <b>confusing</b> when placed in a grid.</p>
        <img src="img/shopsmiles/gap confusing.png" class="margin-add">
        <div class="grid-col-2">
            <p>To avoid this possible confusion, I moved forward with the <b>third option</b> despite the variable height:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><s>A single color selection</s></li>
                <li><s>An empty gap with a fixed card height</s></li>
                <li><b>Have no gap with a variable height</b></li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="padding container-small">
        <img class="border" src="img/shopsmiles/cta size.png" alt="">
        <p>To extra-ensure the issue was addressed, we reduced the <b>width of the call-to-action (CTA)</b> on desktop cards, as desktop screens primarily utilized the grid layout.
            I left the <b>mobile CTA untouched</b>, since (1) no mobile screen used the grid layout and (2) the longer width allowed for a bigger touch area.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="padding container-small">
        <h2>Iteration 3: An accessible color picker</h2>
        <p>However, as we still weren't satisfied with the problem of variable heights, I also came up with a <b>fourth idea</b>: nesting the color selections in a separate button that would prompt to an overlay.</p>
        <p>This button would be always docked, solving the problems of an empty gap or misalignment.</p>
        <img src="img/shopsmiles/overlay options.gif">
        <p>While the idea gained support from the engineering team, we dismissed it as it was ultimately <b>inaccessible</b>, especially for those with screen readers.</p>
        <p>The design would also: (1) be too <b>complex</b> if embedded within a mobile carousel and 
            (2) feel <b>intrusive</b>, causing frequent UX frustrations.</p>
            <div class="bubble-icon yellow">
                <h2>üí°</h2>
                <div>
                    <span><b><i>What I learned...</i></b></span>
                    <p>While my last idea ultimately turned out to be inaccessible, I still learned that the more ideas, the better:</p>
                    <p>By ruling out more and more ideas, not only is there more opportunity to justify the best-design-standing, but I can experiment and understand
                        more about the restrictions (here, I learned more about the engineering restrictions).</p>

            marking the first steps of ShopSmiles' UX overhaul.</h2>
        <p>Product cards are integral to the ecosystem of ShopSmiles, and while I was not able to witness and track the metrics of its impact,
            the redesign is projected to <b>greatly influence users' browsing journeys</b>‚Äîespecially those that drive purchase decisions.</p>
        <p>Additionally, feel free to <a href="https://www.jihyunkim.me/colgate-uxr" target="_blank" class="external-link">read more</a> on how I not only redesigned, 
            but restructured the shopping experience on ShopSmiles with research.</p>

        <h3>If I had more time...</h3>
        <h2>User testing to see what works vs. doesn't.</h2>
        <p>Because of time limitations, the shipment of my designs took place after the completion of my 10-week internship at Colgate-Palmolive.
            Given more time on the project, I would have liked to perform user testing to verify whether the designs had effectively enhanced users' 
            browsing experience on ShopSmiles.

        <h3>Reflection & Takeaways</h3>
        <h2>During my time at Colgate-Palmolive, I not only grew as a designer but gained valuable work ethics and soft skills.</h2>
        <p>Hands down, my teammates at Colgate's UX Team were one of the most supportive and enjoyable people to work with! Although my time at Colgate was short-lived, I learned so much not only about the design process but the cross-functional nature of UX design.</p>
        <img src="img/shopsmiles/reflection w comments.png" class="margin-add">
        <p>Some takeaways from my time at Colgate-Palmolive:</p>
        <h2>Good designers design for everyone.</h2>
        <p>As a company with a large user base, the UX team was especially concerned with the 
            <b>accessibility</b> of its products. A lot of effort was placed into making our designs accessible, whether it be designing for a screen reader or the smallest mobile screen size possible.</p>
        <h2>Organization & documentation is key.</h2>
        <p>Colgate-Palmolive is hundreds of years old, with numerous departments and roles. From this environment, I learned that it's ever-important to <b>keep a record</b> of everything you did and, most importantly, <b><i>why</i> you did them</b>.</p>
        <p>Good organization and documentation not only makes it easier to refer back to one's own work, but makes it easier for others as well‚Äîwhether it be for hand-offs, working in cross-functional environments, or, simply, efficient communication.</p>
