						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>While I knew these design tactics existed, I never knew they were called dark patterns.
							I learned a lot about the different types of dark patterns companies use for their profit, such as the "roach motel" and "forced continuity."
							I also learned that design, as a user-facing field, is intimately tied with ethics.

						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I liked how the author went above and beyond to link dark patterns to larger societal issues such as the threatening of democracy.
							In my classes, I've learned about how misinformation spreads on social media via click bait, but I always thought it was a problem of sensationalist content.
							I didn't realize that the interfaces and interactions of the social media websites themselves were also contributing to the problem of rapid misinformation and disinformation.
