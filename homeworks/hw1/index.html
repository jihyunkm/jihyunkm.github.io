            <li>As someone who’s pursuing product design, this article was actually really interesting and helpful to read.
                I learned that it’s important to always be intentional with your designs, even when it might seem trivial 
                such as how timestamps are displayed on Twitter.</li>
            <li>I liked how the author took the time to show various apps and its UI to demonstrate how to develop a design eye. 
                I appreciated how they not only comment their own observations, but include GIFs breaking down the UI step-by-step.</li>
            <li>“The playlist New Music Friday has a follower count, while the playlist Release Radar does not. 
                Let’s dig into this constraint — because release radar is specific to the user, this would not have followers. 
                Someone had to map out all of the content use cases and decide on the appropriate subheaders to pair with them.”</li>
