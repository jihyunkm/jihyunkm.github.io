						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that so much thought goes into typography, apart from just its legibility and aesthethics. 
								For instance, I did not know you could use the golden ratio or a Modular Scale to calculate the size of fonts.
								Building off this, I think it was interesting to read about and learn how much scientific reasoning goes behind typography and font choice.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of this article was when the author provided different resources for how to choose a font towards the end of the article.
								I personally have difficulty with typography and making font decisions, so I had always thought it would be nice to have a list of resources I can go to when selecting fonts.
								Thus, I really appreciated how the author linked so many different resources for not only how to but why you should choose certain fonts. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"For example, some fonts are more appropriate for children. When learning to read, children need highly legible fonts with generous letter shapes."</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
