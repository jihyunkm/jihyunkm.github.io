					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p>YouTube</p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/MacBook Air - 1.png"/>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>

						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p>The goal of YouTube is to act as a platform where creators can upload their own videos and for anyone to be able to access and enjoy the videos. 
								Their intended audience is “everyone,” as can be seen from their mission statement—”giv[ing] everyone a voice and show[ing] them the world.” 
								The design accomplishes this by being easily navigable and accessible; the site utilizes many common UI patterns such as a search bar, (video) cards, sidebar menu, etc.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p>While it’s easy to scroll through subscriptions on YouTube’s mobile interface, accessing subscriptions on desktop is less intuitive and more cumbersome to scroll through (i.e., a card taking up the entire horizontal space, rather than alike to the home page where it’s in a grid). 
								To address this problem, I created a separate entry point to subscriptions on the home page (horizontal scroll) and separated it from the discover using negative space.</p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
