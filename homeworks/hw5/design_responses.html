                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I learned the various different UI interactions designers typically use in their designs.
                                I noticed that a lot of the designs include animations and transitions.
                                I also noticed that cleaner interfaces have less flashy animations, while bold designs have more animations.

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I liked seeing the various animations designers used for their interfaces. It was interesting to see the different design decisions they made for mobile versus web designs. 
                                I also liked how the interface designs were more experimental--they were designs that I don't see very often in my daily life.

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>I liked the AI Powered Assistant design by Lubo≈° Volkov. I it was intuitive from their design that it was AI-generated, with a help screen imitating AI-helpers such as Siri.
                                Thus, I think the design itself was not only clean, but easy to understand. The direction assistant on the map was also not too experimental, in that it resembles a typical map interface, but also includes clean and delightful designs in a dark mode.</p>

                            <p>4, I liked seeing the designs, but I wish there were more text explaining each of the interfaces.</p>
