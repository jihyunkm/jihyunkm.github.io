							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that design is not only about aesthetics and visual appeal; you need to consider the user psychology when designing interfaces.
								Even interfaces we interact with daily have user psychologies in mind. For a UI design to be considered "well-designed," one needs to utilize psychological methods
								such as the Gestalt principles.

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I appreciated how the Gestalt principles were broken down because although I knew about them before, I never got the 
								opportunity to understand them in depth. For instance, I did not know that similar color conveyed a stronger similarity
								than similar size and shape. I also liked how the author included wireframes of what the UI would look like with the aforementioned 
								Gestalt principles to aid comprehension.

						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about communication, 
								performance and convenience. Gestalt principles are always current helping us achieve these goals; creating a pleasant 
								experience for the users and a great success for the business."</p>
