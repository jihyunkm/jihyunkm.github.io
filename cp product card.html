        <h3>referring to research</h3>
        <h2>üìå According to past internal audits and heuristic evaluations, we discovered that users were pushed away by product cards.</h2>
        <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/heuristic evaluation.png" class="margin-add">
        <p>Product cards touch upon various areas of the site and act as the <b>main drivers of purchase decisions</b> by providing quick gists of information. They allow users to easily compare different products, which is a big user "want."</p>
        <p>However, ShopSmiles' product cards were <b>too large</b> and <b>hard to read</b>‚Äîundermining this value.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <div class="column-2">
            <p class="col-50">I also noted that there were too many variations of the cards throughout the site, making it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Inconsistent</b> for users</li>
                <li><b>Inconvenient</b> to develop</li>

    </div>
</section>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <p>Hence, our <b>main goals</b> for the product card redesign were to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Minimize</b> the number of cards living in the ecosystem</li>
            <li>Increase <b>accessibility</b> in the designs</li>
            <li>Create a well-thought out <b>style guide</b></li>
            <li>Redline all cards for development‚Äîboth the design and usage standards</li>

        <h3>understanding the product card</h3>
        <h2>üîç Before diving into the redesign, I first needed to understand the components and use case of a product card.</h2>
        <div class="bubble-icon">
            <h2 class="no-top-margin">üí¨</h2>
            <span>A <b>product card</b> is a container (common region) of related information regarding a product, presenting information in a visually intuitive and digestible way.</span>

        <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/product cards.png" class="margin-add">
        <p>A card's content depends on what information users deem most important.</p>
        <p>From a required list of elements sent by the marketing team, landscape analyses, and user interviews, 
            we concluded that ShopSmiles' users are most curious of a <b>product's image, name, ratings, and price.</b></p>

        <h3>UNEXPECTED COMPLICATIONS...</h3>
        <h2>üé® As some ShopSmiles products are offered in multiple colors, the business team also wanted a color picker to be accessible on the cards.</h2>
        <p>However, most ShopSmiles products are only offered in a single color and these would <b>instead</b> either show:</p>
        <div style="display: grid; grid-auto-flow: column; column-gap: 16px; margin-top: 32px;">
            <div class="grid-column center-text">
                <p>1. A single color selection</p>

            </div>
            <div class="grid-column center-text">
                <p>2. An empty gap with a fixed card height</p>
                <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/color picker spacing 2.png">
            </div>
            <div class="grid-column center-text">
                <p>3. Have no gap with a variable height</p>

        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <p>Additionally, we decided to display the "Top Picks" in a <b>carousel</b> instead of a list to reduce
            the time it took users to reach the reviews.</p>
        <p>This meant that I had to make sure to <b>minimize</b> the number of complex <b>haptic controls</b> (i.e., nested scrolling, pop-up in a scroll),
            as the color picker would introduce more interactions.</p>

        <h2>1. Wide instead of narrow cards</h2>
        <div class="column-2">
            <div class="col-50">
                <p>Narrow cards allow for <b>higher comparability</b> (can view more products on a single screen), but <b>hinders the tappability</b> of elements, especially for those with small mobile screens.</p>
                <p>Wide cards, on the other hand, might take up more space on the screen, but in turn offer greater <b>accessibility and legibility.</b></p>

                <span><b><i>What I learned...</i></b></span>
                <p>Here, we have the typical business vs. UX dilemma‚Äîshowing more cards for more opportunities for sale versus the contrast to increase accessibility.
                    However, UX teams should always advocate for the user, even more so when accessibility is involved.</p>
                <p>In fact, <i>accessibility -> more users have access -> higher potential for sales!</i> ü§î</p>

    <div class="container-small">
        <h2>2. An intuitive color picker</h2>
        <p>Due to the principles of proximity, the empty gap in place of an inactive color picker looked <b>confusing</b> when placed in a grid.</p>
        <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/gap confusing.png" class="margin-add">
        <p>Thus, to avoid this possible confusion, I decided move forward with the third option despite the variable height:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><s>A single color selection</s></li>
            <li><s>An empty gap with a fixed card height</s></li>
            <li><b>Have no gap with a variable height</b></li>
        </ol>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <h2>3. An accessible color picker</h2>
        <div class="column-2">
            <div>
                <p>However, as we still weren't satisfied with the problem of variable heights, I also came up with a <b>fourth idea</b>: nesting the color selections in a separate button that would prompt to an overlay.</p>
                <p>This button would be always docked, solving the problems of an empty gap or misalignment.</p>
            </div>
            <img class="col-50 margin-add" src="assets/img/shopsmiles/overlay options.gif">
        </div>
        <p>While the idea gained support from the engineering team, we dismissed it as it was ultimately <b>inaccessible</b>, especially for those with screen readers.</p>
        <p>The design would also: (1) be too <b>complex</b> if embedded within a mobile carousel and 
            (2) feel <b>intrusive</b>, causing frequent UX frustrations.</p>
            <div class="bubble-icon yellow">
                <h2 class="no-top-margin">üí°</h2>
                <div>
                    <span><b><i>What I learned...</i></b></span>
                    <p>While my last idea ultimately turned out to be inaccessible, I still learned that the more ideas, the better:</p>
                    <p>By ruling out more and more ideas, not only is there more opportunity to justify the best-design-standing, but I can experiment and understand
                        more about the restrictions (here, I learned more about the engineering restrictions).</p>

        <p>Hands down, my teammates at Colgate's UX team were one of the most supportive and enjoyable people to work with! Although I only was able to work with the team for 10 weeks, I learned so much not only about the design process but the cross-functional nature of UX design.</p>

        <p>Some takeaways from my time at Colgate-Palmolive:</p>
        <h2>üôÜ Good designers design for everyone.</h2>
        <p>As a company with a large user base, the UX team was especially concerned with the 
            <b>accessibility</b> of its products. A lot of effort was placed into making our designs accessible, whether it be designing for a screen reader or the smallest mobile screen size possible.</p>
        <h2>üóÉ Organization & documentation is key.</h2>
        <p>Colgate-Palmolive is hundreds of years old, with numerous departments and roles. From this environment, I learned that it's ever-important to <b>keep a record</b> of everything you did and, most importantly, <b><i>why</i> you did them</b>.</p>
        <p>Good organization and documentation not only makes it easier to refer back to one's own work, but makes it easier for others as well‚Äîwhether it be for hand-offs, working in cross-functional environments, or, simply, efficient communication.</p>
