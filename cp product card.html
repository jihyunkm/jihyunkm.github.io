        <h3 class="red">referring to research</h3>
        <h2>üìå According to past internal audits and heuristic evaluations, we discovered that users were pushed away by product cards.</h2>
        <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/heuristic evaluation.svg" class="img">
        <p>Product cards touch upon various areas of the site and act as the <b>main drivers of purchase decisions</b> by providing quick gists of information. They allow users to easily compare different products, which is a big user "want."</p>
        <p>However, ShopSmiles' product cards were <b>too large</b> and <b>hard to read</b>‚Äîundermining this value.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <div class="column-2">
            <p style="width: 50%;">I also noted that there were too many variations of the cards throughout the site, making it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Inconsistent</b> for users</li>
                <li><b>Inconvenient</b> to develop</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/instances.svg" class="img" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
    </div>
</section>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <p>Hence, our <b>main goals</b> for the product card redesign were to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Minimize</b> the number of cards living in the ecosystem</li>
            <li>Increase <b>accessibility</b> in the designs</li>
            <li>Create a well-thought out <b>style guide</b></li>
            <li>Redline all cards for development‚Äîboth the design and usage standards</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="container-small">
        <h3 class="red">understanding the product card</h3>
        <h2>üîç Before diving into the redesign, I first needed to understand the components and use case of a product card.</h2>
        <div class="bubble-icon">
            <h2 class="no-top-margin">üí¨</h2>
            <span>A <b>product card</b> is a container (common region) of related information regarding a product, presenting information in a visually intuitive and digestible way.</span>
        </div>
        <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/product cards.svg" class="img">
        <p>A card's content depends on what information users deem most important.</p>
        <p>From a required list of elements sent by the marketing team, landscape analyses, and user interviews, 
            we concluded that ShopSmiles' users are most curious of a <b>product's image, name, ratings, and price.</b></p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <h3 class="red">UNEXPECTED COMPLICATIONS...</h3>
        <h2>üé® As some ShopSmiles products are offered in multiple colors, the business team also wanted a color picker to be accessible on the cards.</h2>
        <p>However, most ShopSmiles products are only offered in a single color and these would <b>instead</b> either show:</p>
        <div style="display: grid; grid-auto-flow: column; column-gap: 16px; align-items: end; margin-top: 32px;">
            <div class="grid-column center-text">
                <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/color picker spacing 1.svg">
                <p>1. A single color selection</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-column center-text">
                <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/color picker spacing 2.svg">
                <p>2. An empty gap with a fixed card height</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-column center-text">
                <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/color picker spacing 3.svg">
                <p>3. Have no gap with a variable height</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <p>Additionally, we decided to display the "Top Picks" in a <b>carousel</b> instead of a list to reduce
            the time it took users to reach the reviews.</p>
        <p>This meant that I had to make sure to <b>minimize</b> the number of complex <b>haptic controls</b> (i.e., nested scrolling, pop-up in a scroll),
            as the color picker would introduce more interactions.</p>
        <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/top picks color picker w gradient.svg" class="img">

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <h3 class="red">design explorations & considerations</h3>
        <p>And now, with the components of a product card‚Äîand some restrictions‚Äîin mind, I started exploring the different variations and designs.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <div class="container-small">
        <h2>1. Wide instead of narrow cards</h2>
        <div class="column-2">
            <div><p>Narrow cards allow for <b>higher comparability</b> (can view more products on a single screen), but <b>hinders the tappability</b> of elements, especially for those with small mobile screens.</p>
                <p>Wide cards, on the other hand, might take up more space on the screen, but in turn offer greater <b>accessibility and legibility.</b></p></div>
            <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/narrow wide.svg" style="max-width: 40%;">
        </div>
        
        
    </div>
</section>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <h2>2. An intuitive color picker</h2>
        <p>Due to the principles of proximity, the empty gap in place of an inactive color picker looked <b>confusing</b> when placed in a grid.</p>
        <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/gap confusing.svg" class="img">
        <p>Thus, to avoid this possible confusion, I decided move forward with the third option despite the variable height:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><s>A single color selection</s></li>
            <li><s>An empty gap with a fixed card height</s></li>
            <li><b>Have no gap with a variable height</b></li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <h2>3. An accessible color picker</h2>
        <div class="column-2">
            <div>
                <p>However, as we still weren't satisfied with the problem of variable heights, I also came up with a <b>fourth idea</b>: nesting the color selections in a separate button that would prompt to an overlay.</p>
                <p>This button would be always docked, solving the problems of an empty gap or misalignment.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="assets/img/shopsmiles/overlay options.gif" style="max-width: 320px;" class="img">
        </div>
        <p>While the idea gained support from the engineering team, we dismissed it as it was ultimately <b>inaccessible</b>, especially for those with screen readers.</p>
        <p>The design would also: (1) be too <b>complex</b> if embedded within a mobile carousel and 
            (2) feel <b>intrusive</b>, causing frequent UX frustrations.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>Final Designs</h3>
        <h2>ü§≥ And now, introducing the new cleaner and smaller product cards: easier on the eyes and an easier browsing experience.</h2>
