                <p>Food52 is an online platform that aims to inspire and enliven its expansive community of home cooks by sharing their own recipes and stories. 
                    However, Food52's website experience <b>failed to engage</b> a large portion of its members and approached <a href="" class="external-link">Berkeley Innovation</a> to help address their problem.</p>
                <p>As a <b>Product Design Consultant</b>, I reimagined the website's community to encourage more activity for both existing and new users of Food52 in a newly designed <b>0-to-1 mobile app</b>.</p>

        <h3>the problem</h3>
        <h2>🧑‍💻 There are over two million registered Food52 community members yet the engagement among them is significantly low.</h2>
        <p>While Food52's website offers a variety of <b>community features</b> on its website, there is a <b>huge disparity</b> between the 
            number of registered users and active engagement.</p> 
        <p>In other words, the community is not accurately serving <b>what the users need</b>.</p>
    </div>

<section class="gray-section">
    <div class="container-small">
        <h3>coming up with a question</h3>
        <p>Thus, in order to get started in addressing the drop in engagement, we asked:</p>
        <h2>💭 HMW ensure the website's community offerings meet the <i>needs of our existing members</i> to increase engagement?</h2>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <h3>discovery research</h3>
        <h2>🔎 In order to ensure the user needs were being meant, we first had to conduct research to understand what they were.</h2>
        <p>From the research, we hoped to understand:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to maintain user retention</li>
            <li>How to create or mimic a loyal following</li>
            <li>What makes a successful online community</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To address these questions, we conducted a <b>3-step research plan</b> to identify the pain points and elements of an <b>engaging community</b>.</p>
    </div>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <h3>some pain points we uncovered</h3>
        <h2>🙈 Most of the community is located under a single tab—not visible to many users.</h2>
        <p>While Food52 wanted to spark an engaging community, most of the site's community offerings were located under a single tab. Due to the unintuitive design, majority of users never navigated to, and thus never discovered, these features.</p>
        <p>“I want them to peel back the curtains; don’t just tell me there is community, show me.” - Rachel, Active User
        </p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <h2>😰 Current offerings require users to produce original content, which is both daunting and too high of a commitment.</h2>
        <p>Users are mainly encouraged to participate in the community by posting user-generated content (UGC), such as sharing their own recipes. However, even posting a short comment is time-consuming.</p>
        <p>Most of the website’s traffic is from users searching for others’ recipes, not posting their own. The lack of UGC, in turn, discourages other members to participate as well.</p>
        <p>“I don’t contribute mainly because I don’t have time to.” - Vincent, Non-user</p>
        <p>“If more people were actively engaging, I would feel more encouraged to engage actively.” - Rebecca, Non-user</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="padding">
    <div class="container-small">
        <h2>🤐 Users lack personal connections with other users, undermining trust within the community and disincentivizing participation.</h2>
        <p>Knowing more about other users of a community builds credibility and trust, which encourages contribution. The current Food52 website fails to offer opportunities for users to build authentic connections with others.</p>
        <p>“[For me, the ideal] community is a place to establish friendships.” - Stephanie, Non-user</p>
        <p>“Community is a safe space to share ideas, talk to others, and learn from others.” - Rebecca, Non-user</p>
