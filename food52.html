        <h3>overview</h3>
        <p class="txt-medium">Food52 is an online platform that offers a space for home cooks to share their own recipes and stories
            to connect with others. 
            The team approached <a href="https://berkeleyinnovation.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">Berkeley Innovation</a> 
            to help enliven their community and increase engagement among its members. 
        </p>
        <p class="txt-medium">As a <b>Product Design Consultant</b>, I reimagined the website's community to a newly designed 0->1 mobile app,
            aiming to encourage greater activity for both the existing and new members of Food52.</p>
        <p class="darkgray">*I redesigned this project as an individual designer in 2023 to compare
            my skill growth while showcasing improved designs for the case study. All decisions made
            with the stakeholders were left as was.

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <h2>There is a disparity between the number of registered members & active engagement.</h2>
    <p>Food52 allows all of its member to submit their own recipes, ask questions regarding
        cooking and cookware, and meet like-minded cooks.
        However, while there are <b>2M+</b> registered Food52 members, 
        their <b>engagement</b> with the site's community offerings is significantly low.</p>
    <img src="img/food52/problem.png" alt="">
    
    <div class="gray-section">
        <p>Thus, to address this difference in engagement, Food52 approached us with the following question:</p>
        <h2>How might we ensure Food52's community offerings meet the needs of our existing members to increase engagement?</h2>
    </div>

    <h2 class="padding">But first, what makes an ideal community?</h2>
    <p>Before diving into designing, I first had to understand the necessities of an ideal community. 
        To answer this question, we looked into 6 competitors and social forum platforms
        then conducted <b>14 discovery interviews</b> of active vs. non-Food52 users.
    </p>
    <img src="img/food52/ideal community.png" alt="">
    
    <p class="padding">The ultimate goal of a community is to make friends (was that obvious?). But‚Äîwithout a trustworthy platform of authentic users,
        engagement and interaction cannot arise. </p>
    <p>To increase engagement on Food52, we want to make sure that <b>users trust</b> the site and its members.
        Bonus points if we can shoot above and beyond and foster an environment of <b>organic friendships</b>.
    </p>
    <img class="border" src="img/food52/community pillars.svg" alt="">

    <h2 class="padding">Next, the problem with Food52's community: fragmented, time-consuming, & faceless.</h2>
    <!-- <p>We asked the same pool of users to freely explore Food52 while narrating their thoughts. Our discoveries:</p> -->
    
    <div class="bubble-icon" style="align-items: center;">
        <h2><span class="material-symbols-rounded">
            visibility_off
            </span></h2>
            <p>Most of the community experience is <b>fragmented & hidden</b> under a single tab.</p>      
    </div>
    
    <!-- <p class="txt-medium bold padding"><span class="material-symbols-rounded">

        <img src="img/food52/insights - single tab.png" alt="">
        
        <p>Rather than an integrated experience throughout, Food52's community offerings were located under a single tab. 
            As users mainly come to Food52 for recipes, when we asked users to freely explore Food52's site, they <b>never navigated</b> to the separated community tab‚Äîleaving these features in the dark.</p>

    <div class="bubble-icon" style="margin-top: 6rem;">
        <h2><span class="material-symbols-rounded">
            hourglass_top

            <p>Current offerings require users to produce original content‚Äîboth <b>daunting & too high of a commitment</b>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-col-2">
        <img src="img/food52/insights - ugc.png" alt="">
        <div><p>Users are mainly encouraged to participate in the community by posting user-generated content (UGC), such as sharing their own recipes. However, even posting a short comment is <b>time-consuming</b>.</p>
            <p>The lack of UGC, in turn, discourages other members to participate as they're met with an unengaged community.</p></div>

        <div>
            <p>As discovered before, a successful community is built on reliability and credibility.
