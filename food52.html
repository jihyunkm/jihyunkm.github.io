                <p>Food52 is an online platform that aims to inspire and enliven its expansive community of home cooks by sharing their own recipes and stories. However, Food52's website experience failed to engage a large portion of its members and approached Berkeley Innovation to help address their problem.</p>
                <p>As a Product Design Consultant, I reimagined the website's community to encourage more activity for both existing and new users of Food52 in a newly designed 0-to-1 mobile app.</p>

            <h3>the problem</h3>
            <p>While there are over two million registered community members of the Food52 website, engagement among these members with its current features and offerings is significantly low.</p>
            <p>Thus, to address Food52's large fall out in engagement, we asked:</p>
            <h2>HMW ensure the website's community offerings meet the needs of our existing members to increase engagement?</h2>
